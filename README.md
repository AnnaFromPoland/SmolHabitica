## Description

A user style for [Habitica](https://www.habitica.com) which shrinks the tasks for a more compact global view of all the tasks.

All of the task items are shrinked vertically (only their height is decreased - the text size is not altered). The rewards could not be shrinked as much as the other tasks because I still wanted to have the coin icon displayed ðŸ™‚

The checklists and notes are set not to show in the global view - you can access them by clicking the task in question. I wanted to make the global view as compact and global as possible (so view as many tasks as possible at the "bird's view" level).

In the demo photo (which is a screen of my Habitica) I am also using the Habitica recolour called "[Habitica Dark](https://github.com/jeffsieu/habitica-dark)" created by Jeff Sieu, which you can install using [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) just like my style.
